        <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>Inuyasha is a fun and kid friendly cartoon that children and adults can watch and enjoy. As the show goes, it teaches communication techniques showing children than if we are angry we have choices such as taking our time with
          how we respond by taking a moment or a day to ourselves or by talking it out right away. The show focuses on accepting one another for who we are and even though we all have
        our differences we can interact with each other with respect.</p>
